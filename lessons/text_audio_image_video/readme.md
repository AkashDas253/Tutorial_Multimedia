### Text, Audio, Image, and Video

#### Text

- **Types of Text**:
  - **Plain Text**: Simple text without any formatting, usually in a single color and font. Commonly used for basic document creation and programming.
  - **Rich Text**: Text that includes formatting options like bold, italics, font size, and color. It allows for more expressive content creation (e.g., .rtf files).
  - **Hypertext**: Text that contains links to other texts or resources, allowing users to navigate through content (e.g., web pages).

- **Ways to Present Text**:
  - **Static Presentation**: Traditional printed materials or static web pages where text remains unchanged.
  - **Dynamic Presentation**: Interactive web pages or applications that allow users to manipulate and interact with text content (e.g., blogs, news feeds).

- **Aspects of Text Design**:
  - **Readability**: Ensuring that text is easy to read through appropriate font choice, size, and spacing.
  - **Legibility**: Focuses on how distinguishable the letters and characters are, impacting the user's ability to recognize text quickly.
  - **Hierarchy**: Using size, color, and weight to organize text content, helping users navigate and understand the structure.

- **Character**:
  - A character is a single unit of text, which can be a letter, digit, symbol, or whitespace. Each character has an associated representation in encoding schemes.

- **Character Set**:
  - A collection of characters that a computer can use. Common character sets include ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode, which supports a wider range of characters from multiple languages and scripts.

- **Codes**:
  - Character encoding systems that map characters to binary numbers. ASCII uses 7 or 8 bits per character, while Unicode can use up to 32 bits, accommodating a vast array of characters and symbols.

- **Unicode**:
  - A standard that defines a consistent way of encoding, representing, and handling text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. It allows for the use of multiple languages in a single document.

- **Encryption**:
  - The process of converting plain text into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. Techniques include symmetric encryption (same key for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric encryption (different keys).

#### Audio

- **Basic Sound Concepts**:
  - Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium (air, water, etc.) and can be perceived by human hearing. It consists of vibrations that produce frequency (pitch) and amplitude (loudness).

- **Types of Sound**:
  - **Analog Sound**: Continuous sound waves that can vary in amplitude and frequency. Examples include vinyl records and cassette tapes.
  - **Digital Sound**: Discrete samples of sound waves represented in binary format, allowing for easier manipulation and storage.

- **Digitizing Sound**:
  - The process of converting analog sound waves into digital format through sampling and quantization. This involves capturing sound at regular intervals (sampling) and assigning values (quantization).

- **Computer Representation of Sound**:
  - **Sampling Rate**: The number of samples taken per second (measured in Hertz, Hz). Common rates include 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and 48 kHz (professional audio).
  - **Sampling Size**: The number of bits used to represent each sample, affecting sound quality. Common sizes are 16-bit and 24-bit.
  - **Quantization**: The process of mapping sampled values to discrete levels, influencing the audio's dynamic range and overall fidelity.

- **Audio Formats**:
  - Various formats are used for storing digital audio, including:
    - **WAV**: Uncompressed audio format with high quality but large file size.
    - **MP3**: Compressed format that reduces file size significantly while retaining reasonable quality.
    - **AAC**: Advanced Audio Codec, often used in streaming and broadcast.

- **Audio Tools**:
  - Software applications used for recording, editing, and mixing audio (e.g., Audacity, Adobe Audition).
  - **MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**: A protocol that allows electronic musical instruments and computers to communicate and control sound generation, enabling music composition and production.

#### Image

- **Formats**:
  - Various file formats for images include:
    - **JPEG**: Compressed format ideal for photographs with lossy compression.
    - **PNG**: Lossless compression format supporting transparency; suitable for graphics and web images.
    - **GIF**: Limited to 256 colors, used for simple animations and graphics.
    - **TIFF**: High-quality format used in professional photography and printing.

- **Image Color Scheme**:
  - Refers to the method of representing colors in an image, such as:
    - **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Additive color model used for digital displays.
    - **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)**: Subtractive color model used in color printing.
    - **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)**: Represents colors based on human perception and is useful in graphic design.

- **Image Enhancement**:
  - Techniques used to improve the quality of images, including:
    - **Brightness and Contrast Adjustment**: Altering light levels and contrast to enhance visibility.
    - **Filters and Effects**: Applying artistic effects, blurs, or sharpenings to create specific aesthetics.
    - **Resizing and Cropping**: Modifying image dimensions or focusing on a specific area to improve composition.

#### Video

- **Analogue and Digital Video**:
  - **Analogue Video**: Continuous signal representation, often recorded on magnetic tapes (e.g., VHS).
  - **Digital Video**: Composed of discrete frames represented in binary format, allowing for better quality, editing, and distribution (e.g., MP4, AVI).

- **Recording Formats and Standards**:
  - Various formats are used for video recording, including:
    - **JPEG**: Typically used for still images but can also be part of video compression schemes.
    - **MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)**: A standard for compressing video and audio for transmission and storage (e.g., MPEG-2 for DVDs).
    - **H.261**: A video compression standard primarily used for video conferencing.

- **Transmission of Video Signals**:
  - Video signals can be transmitted via various means, including:
    - **Broadcasting**: Over-the-air transmission using antennas (analog and digital broadcasting).
    - **Cable and Satellite**: Distribution through cable networks or satellite signals.
    - **Streaming**: Delivery over the internet in real-time, allowing users to watch content without downloading entire files (e.g., YouTube, Netflix).

- **Video Capture**:
  - The process of recording video content using cameras, which may include:
    - **Digital Cameras**: Capture high-definition video with advanced sensors and lenses.
    - **Smartphones**: Increasingly capable of recording high-quality video, making video capture accessible to everyone.
    - **Webcams**: Used for video conferencing and live streaming.

- **Computer-Based Animation**:
  - The creation of animated visuals using computer software. Techniques include:
    - **2D Animation**: Traditional animation techniques applied in a digital environment (e.g., Adobe Animate).
    - **3D Animation**: Creating three-dimensional objects and environments (e.g., Autodesk Maya, Blender).
    - **Motion Graphics**: Combining graphic design with animation techniques to create engaging visual content (e.g., After Effects).
