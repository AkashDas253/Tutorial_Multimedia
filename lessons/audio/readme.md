### Audio

#### **1. Basic Sound Concepts**  
Sound is a mechanical wave caused by vibrations that travel through a medium (air, water, or solids) and are perceived by the human ear. The fundamental characteristics include:  
- **Frequency**: Measured in Hertz (Hz), it determines pitch (high or low sounds).  
- **Amplitude**: Determines the loudness of sound, measured in decibels (dB).  
- **Velocity**: Speed at which sound travels through a medium (approximately 343 m/s in air).  
- **Wavelength**: Distance between successive peaks of a wave, inversely proportional to frequency.  
- **Timbre**: The quality of sound that distinguishes different sources.

#### **2. Types of Sound**
- **Natural Sound**: Produced by natural phenomena (e.g., thunder, waves).  
- **Synthetic Sound**: Created using computers or electronic devices (e.g., MIDI, synthesizers).  
- **Speech Sound**: Produced by humans for communication.  
- **Music Sound**: Organized tones with rhythm, melody, and harmony.  
- **Noise**: Random, unwanted sound without any pattern.

#### **3. Digitizing Sound**  
Digitization involves converting analog sound waves into digital signals that computers can process. The process involves:  
1. **Sampling**: Capturing sound waves at discrete intervals.  
2. **Quantization**: Assigning numerical values to the sampled amplitudes.  
3. **Encoding**: Converting quantized values into binary format.

#### **4. Computer Representation of Sound**
Sound is represented digitally using the following parameters:  

**a. Sampling Rate**  
- Number of samples captured per second.  
- Measured in Hertz (Hz).  
- Common rates:  
  - **44.1 kHz**: CD-quality sound.  
  - **48 kHz**: Professional audio.  
  - **96 kHz**: High-definition audio.  
- Higher sampling rates ensure better sound quality.

**b. Sampling Size (Bit Depth)**  
- Number of bits used to represent each sample.  
- Common sizes:  
  - **8-bit**: Low quality, limited dynamic range.  
  - **16-bit**: CD-quality sound, used in most applications.  
  - **24-bit**: High-quality audio for professional use.

**c. Quantization**  
- Converts the amplitude of sound into discrete levels.  
- Higher quantization levels (e.g., 16-bit vs. 8-bit) result in better sound quality and less noise.

#### **5. Audio Formats**  
Audio formats store digital sound in various ways:  

**a. Lossy Formats**  
- Compress data by removing inaudible frequencies.  
- Smaller file sizes but lower quality.  
- Examples: MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG.

**b. Lossless Formats**  
- Retain all audio data, ensuring high quality.  
- Larger file sizes.  
- Examples: FLAC, ALAC, WAV.

**c. Uncompressed Formats**  
- Store raw audio data without compression.  
- Extremely large file sizes.  
- Examples: WAV, AIFF.

#### **6. Audio Tools**  
Software and hardware tools are used for creating, editing, and managing audio.  

**a. Audio Editing Software**  
- **Audacity**: Open-source tool for editing and recording.  
- **Adobe Audition**: Professional editing software.  
- **GarageBand**: Audio production tool for Mac users.

**b. Hardware Tools**  
- **Microphones**: Capture sound.  
- **Audio Interfaces**: Convert analog sound to digital.  
- **Speakers/Monitors**: Output sound.  

**c. Plugins**  
- Enhance audio editing capabilities. Examples include VST, AU, and AAX plugins.

#### **7. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**  
- **Definition**: A protocol for communication between electronic instruments and computers.  
- **Functionality**:  
  - Transfers musical notes, tempo, and instrument settings instead of actual sound.  
  - Requires MIDI controllers (e.g., keyboards).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Compact file size.  
  - Easy to edit and manipulate.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Music production, live performances, and film scoring.
